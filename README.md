# Pandas Tutorial: Analyzing Data with Python
Ready to learn pandas, the most powerful data analysis library in Python?   In this tutorial, we will analyse a real-world dataset - my YouTube data. We start by reading and inspecting the data before doing exploratory data analysis (EDA). Once we understand the data well, I will show you advanced techniques to clean up the dataframe. To do so, we will take advantage of chaining pandas methods to keep the code clean and organised. With our clean dataframe, we will then perform a timeseries analysis and plot our findings in interactive charts.
